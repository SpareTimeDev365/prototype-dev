# Prototype Dev

## Intro
I would like to learn game dev by making games! So this repo shows the projects of making game protytpes by Godot Game Engine. 

Someone recommended me to take the 20 Games Challenges, and I think its a great idea to follow the challenges. Below is the goal for my plan.

## Goal
- Complete at least 10 Games in [20 Games Challenges](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/)
- Share & Deploy complete games to the internet players.
- Average spend no more than 2 weeks on every games development (could be extend if need it.)
- Watching tutorial should be the last action if I can't figure out how to solve a specfic problem.
- Plan should be stop no matter how much game has complete after 6 months

## Duration
- Stage 1: 2025/04/25 ~ 2025/10/31
- Stage 2: TBD
